# RelMan
RelationshipManager is an app to store contact data to remind you of birthdays, but most importantly, to regularly reach out to family, friends and professional contacts. 
The database is an Excel File, so that it can be modified not only using the app.

The notification functionality is taken from birday (https://github.com/m-i-n-a-r/birday), which generally served as a great example to get into Android app programming with Kotlin. Check it out!
This project is mainly for myself and to peek into app programming.

Other planned features:
- Show birthday and reach outs of today on the home screen
- Import contact data from regular sources (phone contacts, Google account etc.)
- Search filters for contact list, at least for names
- Smart diary tab to connect memories with people
